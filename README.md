Shout webapp
============

A React-based version of the Shout resource tool, intended for use as a hybrid app (web, Android, IOS).

To use:

* Install Node.js (developed with version 6)
* clone the repo and ```cd``` to it
* ```npm install```
* ```npm start``` to start dev server
* open a browser to http://localhost:8080 (Webpack is used for hot updates as files are edited)
* Install Cordova as used
* run cordova app, eg ```cordova run android```


* (#1: if npm start fails at : 'node config && HOST=0.0.0.0 webpack-dev-server' then remove "HOST=0.0.0.0" from that line in package.json)
